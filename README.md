# Snake-Game
**_Snake Game_**<br/>
I made this project using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScipt. This game revives our old childhood memories.

In this project, I tried to put all the functions which are present in the original snake game like whenever a snake eats its food its size/length will increase and when it collides with a wall or with itself the game over message will appears. I also implemented score board in which the current score and top score is displayed. The top score is stored locally.
